R script for seminar case study in QMarketing at Erasmus University.

All individual simulation studies can be run in main.R, in simulation_study.R the input parameters can be given.

Computing reach and frequency can also be obtained by running  the specific functions in main.R.
All relevant Nielsen Data files should be added in folders names: "exposures_all" -  for all exposure files that need to be evaluated and "other_data" - for all other data files.

To run the weighted true vs estimated likelihood, the branch "Nikos_likelihood" needs to be used.

For evaluation of results and data different functions have again been created and can be used from main.R
